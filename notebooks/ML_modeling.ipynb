    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to obtain one or more Machine Learning models to predict whether an employee will leave within 2 years from his HR data.\n",
    "Several models will be optimised and tested in order to select the best one(s) and deploy them afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is it done?\n",
    "\n",
    "I approach this problem by starting with a model that predicts the majority class in the training data, which is the minimum performance of a useful model (Baseline model).\n",
    "\n",
    "I then compare 3 Machine Learning models with features relevant to this task: features_importance and probabilities per class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to optimize these models I use RandomizedSearchCV followed by GridSearchCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The properties of these models are important because they provide useful functionality for delivery via HR software: \n",
    "- one could classify employees being detected as wanting to leave the company by probability and thus prioritise them \n",
    "- one can also interpret the coefficients of the models and analyse the factors causing the departure to correct them\n",
    "- we can also give arguments to HR to communicate with employees."

    "- an approach using **Bayesian optimisation.**\n",
    "\n",

    "The approach that gave the best results and with a lower computation time (this must be qualified slightly because there was no polynomial features step for this model) than the others is the one using XGboost and a Bayesian optimisation.\n",

    "The XGboost algorithm and library being particularly powerful and optimised, it is not surprising that the best results come from this model (both in terms of performance and calculation time).\n",

    "**The Bayesian optimisation approach also seems to be faster than the randomizesearch + gridsearch approach.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the XGboost model is excellent according to our business metrics.\n",
